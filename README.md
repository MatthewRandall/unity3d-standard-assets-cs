Unity3D-Standard-Assets-CS
==========================

A C# drop in replacement for the default Unity3D "Standard Assets Package" and its JS camera and general scripts.


Why
===

There is nothing special about the conversions done in this package. The goal was to simplify the interfacing between Unity3D CS script and the legacy "Standard Assets" JS scripts. The motivation to port these JS scripts to C# was due largely in part to the fact that you
cannot call scripts between JS and C# which made customizations to the camera scripts specifically useless as it related to the development of Unity3D games using C# scripting. 


What
====

I shoved this into GitHub so that others could gain access to the source to use and or manipulate as required by your Unity3D game project.
